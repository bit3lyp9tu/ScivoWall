# ScaDS poster generator (tbd)

![Current build status](https://github.com/bit3lyp9tu/scientific_poster_generator/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

Idea is to have a centralized poster generator, which allows visual editing of
scientific poster with LaTeX, images, lists and so on (almost full markdown support).

# Setup
To setup the container environment, you have to run the folowing command:
```console
bash docker.sh --local-port 1112
```
The ```--local-port``` parameter indicates which network port the server is using. This parameter is strictly required for the setup command to work.

Using the ```--showcase``` parameter will load a database with already preconfigured posters.

If you want to know if everything is setup correctly, optionally you can use:
```console
bash docker.sh --local-port 1112 --run-tests
```

After executing the setup script you can access the page in a browser of your choice at ```http://localhost:1112/```.

For further information please refer to the [User Manual](documentation/docu.md).
